The Little Prince

Once upon a time, a little prince lived on a small planet, barely larger than a house. He spent his days tending to his tiny world, pulling up baobab sprouts to keep them from taking over, and caring for a single, delicate rose.

One day, he decided to explore the universe. He visited several planets, meeting strange and interesting characters: a king who ruled over nothing, a vain man who wanted only admiration, a drunkard drowning in his own shame, and a businessman counting the stars as if they were his to own.

Finally, he arrived on Earth and met a wise fox. The fox taught him an important lesson: "One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye."

As the little prince prepared to return to his planet, he realized that his rose was unique because he had cared for her. Though he left Earth, his spirit remained, reminding us to cherish love and friendship above all else.

The end.
